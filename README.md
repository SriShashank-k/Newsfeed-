NewsFeed+ is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive and personalized news reading experience. With a user friendly interface and seamless integration of news articles from various sources, NewsFeed+ aims to keep users
informed and engaged with the latest updates across different topics of interest. The application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsiveness. The backend is powered by Django, a Python web framework,
offering scalability features. Data management relies on Django's ORM interacting with a relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL). External APIs like the News API are integrated for real-time news updates. Security measures include user authentication and authorization to safeguard data and prevent unauthorized access.
